# The Doggy Company® — Pet Life Operating System
## Product Requirements Document — MASTER
## Last Updated: Mar 2026 (Session 81 — 4 more Play page issues fixed: breed filter in Mira picks, soul question chips, soul score consistency across all pillars, bundle modal scrollable)

---

## PRODUCT VISION
The Doggy Company's Pet Life Operating System (PLOS) is a pillar-based platform where each pillar (DINE, CARE, GO, CELEBRATE, etc.) is a fully personalised experience for a named dog, powered by Mira — the AI concierge who knows every dog by name, breed, size, health and soul. Every product recommendation, every guided path, every service booking is filtered through Mira's knowledge of the pet.

**Core Philosophy**: The soul profile is the dog's operating system. Every pillar reads from it and personalises everything.

## GO PILLAR — DETAILED CURRENT STATE

### What's Working ✅
1. **GoHero** — Centered column layout (matches DineHero): avatar top-center, "Travel & Go / for [name]" two-line serif title, soul chips (breed + city + size + anxiety), Mira quote
2. **GoTabBar** — Centered pill tabs: "✈️ Go Essentials" | "🏡 Find a Stay" | "🗺️ Book a Service"
3. **GoCategoryStrip** — 6 scrollable pills: Safety 🛡️, Calming 😌, Carriers 🎒, Feeding 🥣, Health & Docs 💊, Stay & Board 🏡 → each opens GoContentModal popup
4. **GoContentModal** — Teal popup with allergy-filtered products, Mira quote, sub-category tabs, Mira Imagines cards
5. **GuidedGoPaths** — 3-column card grid (EXACTLY like GuidedCarePaths): 6 paths, GoPathCard with accent bg + icon + chips + Mira Pick badge + PathFlowModal
6. **PetFriendlyStays** — Worldwide destination search: autocomplete (30 suggestions), 12 popular city chips, 6 type filters (Hotels/Resorts/Homestays/Boarding/Camping), auto-fetches pet's city on mount, Google Places backend
7. **TripProfile compact bar** — Always shows: breed chip + city chip + size chip + anxiety chip + allergy chips (never empty)
8. **DimExpanded inline panels** — 6 dimension cards expand inline with products (DIM_ID_TO_KEYWORDS keyword matching)
9. **MiraPicksSection** — AI-scored picks with shimmer skeleton loader; fires background scoring on page load
10. **Go Essentials tab** — TripProfile + MiraPicksSection + dim cards + DimExpanded + GuidedGoPaths (clean, no concierge)
11. **Book a Service tab** — GoConcierge + GoConciergeSection

### What's MISSING / Pending 🔴

#### IMMEDIATE (P0) — Requested in latest user message:
1. **TripProfile drawer never empty** — When all soul questions answered, the drawer should show **breed-specific travel tips** (like Care's "BEST PRACTICES · INDIE" section shows breed care tips). For Go, this means: breed-specific travel tips (e.g., for Indies: "Short-coated, adaptable — heat management on long car journeys essential"), travel watch-outs (e.g., heat stroke risk in long boot journeys), comfort preferences. CURRENTLY: shows "Mojo's trip profile is complete!" with ✈️ emoji and blank space below — needs the breed travel insight cards like Care's wellness drawer.

2. **Soul Picks pill in GoCategoryStrip** — Screenshot shows "Soul Care" (purple sparkle 🌟) and "Mira's Picks" (pink magic wand 🪄) as icon pills in the strip. For Go: **"Soul Go" pill** that opens a modal showing AI soul-scored products for travel (breed + size + travel-profile filtered). This is DIFFERENT from the regular category pills — it surfaces the TOP products across all 6 categories that are most relevant to this specific dog.

3. **Mira's Picks pill in GoCategoryStrip** — Second special pill: **"Mira's Picks"** (pink wand icon) that opens a modal showing Mira's top picks + Mira Imagines travel destination cards at the bottom. Same pattern as Care.

4. **Service box blocks in "Book a Service" tab** — The Excel has 8 canonical Go services (GO-SVC-001 to GO-SVC-008). These need to be:
   - Inserted into the `service_box` MongoDB collection with `pillar: 'go'`
   - Displayed in two visual blocks: "Travel Services" and "Stay & Board Services"
   - Each block shows watercolour illustration cards (same as "Care, Personally" in the screenshot)
   - The watercolour images need to be generated for each service

#### DATABASE WORK (from Excel):
5. **23 new Go Essentials products** (GO-SAF-001 to GO-HLT-002) — Status: ADD in Excel
6. **13 Stay & Board products** (GO-STY-001 to GO-SS-003) — Status: ADD in Excel
7. **21 Stay & Board sub-category products** (GO-BC-001 to GO-SS-003) with tabs: boarding_comfort, daycare_essentials, pet_sitting_kit, hotel_comfort, first_stay_anxiety, soul_stay
8. **14 bundles** (BUN-GO-T001 to BUN-GO-S008) — 6 travel + 8 stay bundles
9. **DALL-E images** need to be generated for all new products using the admin panel's Soul Products → Mockup Generator tool
10. **8 canonical Go services** to insert into service_box collection

---

## GO PILLAR — NEXT AGENT ACTION ITEMS

### Step 1: TripProfile Breed Travel Tips (Care Pattern)
**File**: `/app/frontend/src/pages/GoSoulPage.jsx`
**Function**: `TripProfile` component (starts around line 443)
**What to do**: After the soul score progress bar and either the questions list OR the "profile complete" state, add a **`GoBreedTravelInsights`** sub-component that shows:
- Dark teal header card: "TRAVEL TIPS · [BREED NAME]" (like Care's "BEST PRACTICES · INDIE")
- 4 insight cards in a 2×2 grid:
  1. Travel preparation tip (carrier/harness sizing for breed)
  2. Journey comfort tip (heat management, hydration)
  3. Stay tip (boarding suitability, familiar scents)
  4. Watch-out card (orange: anxiety triggers, health risks in transit)
  5. A "Dental/Docs" equivalent = "Documents" card (blue: vaccination cert, health cert, pet passport)
- This should show even when "profile is complete" — replace the empty area below the ✈️ emoji

**Reference implementation**: `WellnessProfile.jsx` (look for `BreedInsightCard` function, around line 200+). Copy the structure, change colors from sage green to teal.

**Breed data needed**: Build a lookup table `GO_BREED_TRAVEL_TIPS` with entries for: Indie, Golden Retriever, Labrador, Beagle, Shih Tzu, Pug, German Shepherd, Husky, Poodle, Dachshund, Rottweiler, Cocker Spaniel. Each entry has: preparation, comfort, stay, watchFor, documents fields. Default for unknown breeds.

### Step 2: Soul Go + Mira's Picks Pills in GoCategoryStrip
**File**: `/app/frontend/src/components/go/GoCategoryStrip.jsx`
**What to do**:
1. Add two special icon-only pills at the START of the strip (before Safety):
   - **Soul Go** pill: Purple-to-lilac gradient background, ✨ sparkle icon, label "Soul Go" — opens a `SoulGoModal` (new file)
   - **Mira's Picks** pill: Pink gradient background, 🪄 wand icon, label "Mira's Picks" — opens `MiraGoPicksModal` (new file)
2. **`SoulGoModal`** (new component): Fetches `/api/mira/claude-picks/{petId}?pillar=go` → Shows top AI-scored products across all go categories, with allergy filtering. Falls back to Mira Imagines if no scored picks.
3. **`MiraGoPicksModal`** (new component): Shows `MiraPicksSection` content (from GoSoulPage) in a full modal + Mira Imagines travel destination cards at the bottom.

**Reference**: See `CareCategoryStrip.jsx` for how Soul Care + Mira's Picks pills are implemented there.

### Step 3: Service Box — Insert Go Services + Build UI
**Backend**:
- Insert the 8 canonical Go services (GO-SVC-001 to GO-SVC-008) into MongoDB `service_box` collection with `pillar: 'go'`
- Script: Write a migration script `/app/backend/seed_go_services.py`
- Each service needs: `id, name, pillar, sub_pillar (travel|stay), tagline, description, steps[], accent_colour, watercolour_image_url (null initially), base_price, is_bookable`

**Frontend** - Update `GoConciergeSection.jsx`:
- Currently fetches `GET /api/service-box/services?pillar=go` → returns 0 (no go services yet)
- After seeding, this will return 8 services
- **Split into 2 sections**:
  - Section 1: "Go, Personally — Travel" — Shows travel services (flight, road, taxi, planning, emergency, relocation)
  - Section 2: "Go, Personally — Stay & Board" — Shows stay services (boarding, sitting, daycare, hotel finding)
- Each card: watercolour illustration (or gradient fallback), category badge, service name, description, "Book [pet]'s [service] →" CTA in gold

**Reference**: `CareConciergeSection.jsx` for the exact UI pattern. Check the screenshot (image 4 in user's last message) — "Care, Personally" with 4-col grid of watercolour illustration cards.

### Step 4: Insert New Products from Excel
**Script**: `/app/backend/seed_go_products_v4.py`
- 23 Go Essentials products (GO-SAF-001 to GO-HLT-002)
- 13 Stay & Board products (GO-STY-001 to GO-SS-003)
- 21 Stay & Board sub-category products (GO-BC-001 to GO-SS-003)
- All with `pillar: 'go'` and proper `category` + `sub_category` fields
- Image generation: Use admin panel → Soul Products → Mockup Generator (user task, not DALL-E)
- 14 bundles to insert into `bundles_go` collection (or unified `bundles` collection)

## DATABASE COLLECTIONS

| Collection | Count | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| `products_master` | ~2,000+ | Main product catalog. Go: 528, Care: 468, Dine: 524 |
| `service_box` | 200+ | Services. Currently only `adopt` + `advisory` pillars active |
| `mira_product_scores` | Variable | AI scoring results per pet per pillar |
| `pet_soul_profile` | Variable | Dog soul answers, soul score |
| `users` | Variable | Member accounts |
| `pets` | Variable | Pet data |

### Critical DB Fix Needed
The `service_box` collection has NO `go` pillar services. 8 canonical services from Excel need to be inserted before the "Book a Service" tab can show anything meaningful.

## COMPLETED SESSION LOG

### Session 73 (Feb 2026) — Breed Filtering Fix + Play DB Cleanup + Soul Products in Grids
- **Breed filtering in All Products**: PlaySoulPage, GoSoulPage, CareSoulPage products fetch now depends on `[petData]` — soul products (breed_tags set) filtered to only show the current pet's breed. Generic products (no breed_tags) show for all pets.
- **Soul products in Care/Play grids**: After loading products, also fetches `/api/breed-catalogue/products?pillar={pillar}&breed={petBreed}` and merges into the soul dimension group. Now Care "Soul Care" dim and Play "Soul Play" dim both show breed-specific products.
- **DB cleanup**: Deleted 7 fake play products ("Outings & Parks", "Playdates", "Dog Walking", etc. with Rs.999). Remaining: 21 real play products + 8 services + 132 breed bandanas/cards.
- **Multiple pets confirmed working**: Mojo (Indie), Mystique (Shih Tzu), Bruno (Labrador) — each sees their own breed's soul products.

### Session 72 (Feb 2026) — Concierge CTAs + Sub-cat Formatting + Soul Go Personalised
- **ConciergeToast**: New `/app/frontend/src/components/common/ConciergeToast.jsx` — bottom fixed toast slides up when "Book via Concierge" clicked on any nearby place card. Auto-dismisses in 5s.
- **handleNearMeBook wired**: GoSoulPage (TRAVEL queue), CareSoulPage (GROOMING queue), PlaySoulPage (PLAY queue) all now POST to `/api/service_desk/attach_or_create_ticket` + `handoff_to_concierge` and show `ConciergeToast`.
- **Sub-category names fixed**: All DimExpanded tab labels now use `.replace(/_/g,' ').replace(/\b\w/g,c=>c.toUpperCase())` — `boarding_comfort` → `Boarding Comfort` across all 4 pillars.
- **GoContentModal Personalised tab**: Added Products/Personalised toggle to ALL GoContentModal categories (not just soul). Shows `PersonalisedBreedSection` with breed-specific go products when "Personalised" is selected.
- **Play category strip connected** (carried over from Session 71): PlayCategoryStrip pills now trigger `setOpenDim` to open DimExpandedModal.
- **Personalised tab in all DimExpanded**: All 4 pillars' inline DimExpanded panels now have Products/Personalised toggle showing PersonalisedBreedSection.

### Session 71 (Mar 18, 2026) — PLAY Pillar All 8 UI Issues Fixed
- **Play Pillar `/play` route**: Full 3-tab page (Play & Explore | Find Play | Book a Service)
- **PlayNearMe**: Google Places parks search with `features[]` array (off_lead, beach_access, shade, water_nearby, dog_park mapped from Google types)
- **Backend**: `/api/places/play-spots` endpoint with automatic Google Places types → features mapping
- **25 new Play products** seeded (PL-OUT-001 to PL-SL-004) + 66 soul play products tagged
- **8 canonical Play services** seeded into services_master
- **PlayCategoryStrip**: Soul Play + Mira's Picks as first 2 pills
- **Navbar**: "Enjoy" → "Play" with /play route
- **Complete HTML docs**: `/app/complete-go-play-documentation.html` created
- **Mira Orb**: Teal #1ABC9C (was pink/purple)
- **Dine duplicate heading**: Fixed — "How would Mojo love to eat?" now only in eat tab
- **Care Find Care tab**: Added 3rd tab with CareNearMe.jsx + `/api/places/care-providers` backend

### Session 69 (Mar 17, 2026) — GO Pillar P0/P1 Features Complete
- **Soul Go + Mira's Picks pills**: Added 2 special AI-powered pills as first entries in GoCategoryStrip.jsx; wired to GoContentModal.jsx with special fetch logic for `/api/mira/claude-picks/{pet_id}?pillar=go`
- **GoBreedTravelInsights**: Added always-visible breed travel insights to TripProfile drawer; dark teal header + 4-tip grid + Watch For + Documents cards; 12 breeds + Indie + default fallback
- **Book a Service tab populated**: GoConciergeSection.jsx rewrote to show 2 separate sections — "Go, Personally — Travel" (6 services) + "Go, Personally — Stay & Board" (2 services)
- **21 new Stay & Board products seeded**: GO-BC-001 to GO-SS-003 inserted into `products_master` (boarding_comfort, daycare_essentials, pet_sitting_kit, hotel_comfort, first_stay_anxiety, soul_stay)
- **8 canonical Go services seeded**: GO-SVC-001 to GO-SVC-008 inserted into `services_master` with `pillar=go`
- **AI images generated**: All 52 go products now have Cloudinary AI-generated images
- **Continuous image generation**: `continuous_image_gen.py` + `auto_mockup_generator.py` running in background cycling through all pillars

### Session 73b (Mar 18, 2026) — Play Products Fixed + Mira's Picks Dim Card Added
- **PlaySoulPage.jsx breed filter fix**: Products tagged with `breed_tags: ['all_breeds']` were being incorrectly filtered out. Fixed to allow `all_breeds`/`all` tagged products to show for all pets. Indie pets now see 109 play products (was broken before).
- **Mira's Picks dim card added**: Play page now has 7 dimension cards (was 6). Added "Mira's Picks" (🪄) card to the grid matching Care/Dine pattern. Clicking it opens a centered modal showing MiraPicksSection (AI-scored products with breed/energy/size matching).
- **Standalone MiraPicksSection removed** from Play page body (it's now exclusively inside the Mira's Picks dim card).
- All 25 Excel play products confirmed present in DB.


- **PlaySoulPage.jsx**: Fixed `DimExpandedModal` from bottom-sheet → centered full-screen modal on desktop (responsive: centered on ≥768px, bottom-sheet on mobile). Added `isDesktop` state with window resize listener.
- **All 4 pillar pages**: Added `SoulMadeCollection` component below `PersonalisedBreedSection` in the "Personalised" tab. Pillar→pillar mapping: play→enjoy, go→travel, care→care, dine→dine
- **GoContentModal.jsx**: Also updated with `SoulMadeCollection` in the Personalised tab (pillar=travel)
- Imported `SoulMadeCollection` in GoSoulPage, CareSoulPage, DineSoulPage, PlaySoulPage
