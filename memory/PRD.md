## ✅ SESSION 37 — Services Architecture Fix + Celebrate Full CRUD (Mar 15, 2026)

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. Services Architecture — Shop Removed (PERMANENT FIX)
- **Problem**: 561 services had `pillar: ''`, 392 had `pillar: 'shop'` (wrong — shop is for products)
- **Fix**: Keyword-heuristic script reassigned all services to correct pillars (care, emergency, advisory, etc.)
- **Product-type entries** in services_master (type='product') → marked `is_active: False`
- **ServiceBox admin**: Removed 'shop' from ALL_PILLARS array → now shows only 13 true service pillars
- **Architecture rule**: Shop = products by sub-category | Services = services from all 13 pillars

#### 2. Celebrate Products Admin — Full CRUD (1,499 products)
- **Problem**: Admin only showed 4 products (from `celebrate_products`), missing 1,495 from `products_master`
- **Fix**: `GET /api/celebrate/admin/products` now merges both collections
- **Features Added**: Pagination (50/page), search, category filter, total count display
- **Image Upload**: File upload button → `/api/upload/product-image` → Cloudinary
- **AI Generate Image**: Button calls `/api/celebrate/admin/products/{id}/generate-image`  
- **Shopify Badge**: Products from products_master show "Shopify" badge
- **Delete**: Soft-delete for products_master (marks inactive), hard delete for celebrate_products

#### 3. Architecture Documentation Updated
- HTML audit at `/app/docs/architecture_audit.html` updated with all fixes
- All data counts corrected

### Testing Results (Session 37):
- **Backend**: All tests passed ✅
- **Frontend**: CelebrateManager loads 1,499 products ✅
- **Services**: 13 pillars in ServiceBox (no 'shop') ✅

---

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. Product Activation (CRITICAL DATA FIX)
- **Problem**: 3,960 products in `products_master` had no `active` field → showing 0 products everywhere
- **Fix**: Script `update_many(active missing → set active: True)` on all products with `image_url`
- **Result**: 3,987 products now active ✅

#### 2. PricingHub Pillar Bundles Tab (COMPLETE REWRITE)
- **Problem**: Only showed 5 pillars from wrong pillar-specific endpoints with wrong field names
- **Fix**: Rewrote `PillarBundlesSection` to use `GET /api/bundles?active_only=false` (unified collection)
- **Result**: Shows all **13 pillars**, 39 bundles total, inline price editing works ✅

#### 3. Bundle Pricing PATCH Endpoint (NEW FEATURE)
- **Added**: `PATCH /api/bundles/{id}/pricing` in `bundle_routes.py`
- Allows lightweight pricing-only updates (original_price, bundle_price, active)
- Auto-recalculates discount %

#### 4. Admin Navigation Fix
- **Problem**: Admin > Celebrate (sidebar) showed blank page (no render case for `activeTab === 'celebrate'`)
- **Fix**: Added `{activeTab === 'celebrate' && <CelebrateManager />}` render case in `Admin.jsx`

#### 5. Bundle Crash Fixes (Carried from Session 35)
- `BundlesManager.jsx`: `typeof item === 'object' ? item.name : item` for object items
- `LearnManager.jsx`: Same typeof check

#### 6. Architecture Documentation
- Created comprehensive HTML audit at `/app/docs/architecture_audit.html`
- API endpoint to serve it: `GET /api/docs/architecture-audit`

### Testing Results (Session 36):
- **Backend**: 15/15 tests passed ✅
- **Frontend**: 90% — CelebrateManager navigation fixed ✅
- **P0 Crash**: Resolved ✅

---

### Audit Results (All 4 Flows CONFIRMED Working):
1. **Admin Notification Bell** ✅ — `celebrate_picks_request` notifications appear immediately when user selects Mira Picks (API: `GET /api/admin/notifications`, 663+ total)
2. **Service Desk Ticket** ✅ — Ticket created with `status=new` and full pet/user info (API: `GET /api/tickets/`, 559 total)  
3. **Channel Intake (Unified Inbox)** ✅ — Entry created in `mira_picks_panel` channel (API: `GET /api/channels/intakes`)
4. **Member Notification** ✅ — `picks_request_received` appears in Dipali's notification inbox after sorting fix

### Bug Fixed:
- **Member notification sort bug**: `created_at` stored as BSON datetime in old notifications vs ISO string in new picks notifications caused MongoDB to sort by type (9 > 2), putting old items first. Fixed by sorting `_id` (ObjectId insertion order) in both `/api/member/notifications/inbox/{email}` (server.py line 17088) and `/api/user/notifications` (user_tickets_routes.py line 933)

### Key Finding:
- The bug was NOT in the data creation (all data was being saved correctly)
- It was a MongoDB sort bug causing newest `picks_request_received` to appear hidden behind older `pet_wrapped` notifications

---

### What Was Added:
1. **Service Pricing tab** in Pricing, Shipping & Commercial Hub — 7th tab added (was 6, now 7)
2. **Backend**: New `PATCH /api/service-box/services/{service_id}/pricing` endpoint for atomic pricing updates (only `base_price`, `discounted_price`, `active`, `is_free`, `sort_order`)
3. **Frontend**: Full service pricing table with: Service image/name/id, Pillar badge, Base Price, Discounted Price, Active status — all inline-editable
4. **Seed from Product Box** bug: Was only happening on old preview URL (celebrate-products). Our current environment (`celebrate-sync-3`) works fine — endpoint returns migrated/skipped stats
5. **Pillar field handling**: Fixed pillar badge to handle both string `'fit'` and array `[]` formats in service data

### Files Modified:
- `service_box_routes.py` — Added `PATCH /services/{service_id}/pricing` endpoint
- `PricingHub.jsx` — Added services state, fetchServices, updateServicePricing, Service Pricing tab

---

### What Was Fixed/Added:
1. **Enjoy pillar crash fix** — `credentials is not defined` error when clicking Bundles tab was fixed by removing invalid `credentials={credentials}` prop from PillarBundlesTab in EnjoyManager.jsx
2. **Services tab added to 7 pillar managers:** Fit(23), Farewell(8), Emergency(8), Learn(12), Paperwork(16), Advisory(8), Adopt(0 — none seeded yet)
3. Each Services tab uses `PillarServicesTab` component with `pillar="{slug}"` calling `GET /api/service-box/services?pillar={slug}`
4. **Testing:** 100% pass rate (8/8 features) — iteration_132.json

---

## ✅ SESSION 31 — Sync to Production + Create New Product/Service (Mar 15, 2026)

### What Was Verified/Completed:
1. **Sync to Production (MASTER SYNC)** — Confirmed the "Sync to Production" button includes the Celebrate Excel Catalog seeding step (Step 11.5/12) at `Admin.jsx` line 609. Calls `POST /api/admin/celebrate/seed-from-excel`.
2. **SYNC → PROD button** — Also includes the Celebrate Excel Catalog seeding step (Step 2) at `Admin.jsx` line 3510 after the mockup sync.
3. **Create New Product** — The "Add Product" button in Product Box (COMMERCE section) was already implemented. Opens a 6-tab editor dialog. Saves via `POST /api/product-box/products`. Verified working: product count increased from 3954 → 3955 after test.
4. **Create New Service** — The "Add Service" button in Service Box was already implemented. Opens a 4-tab editor dialog. Saves via `POST /api/service-box/services`. Verified working: service count increased from 1117 → 1118 after test.
5. **Testing:** 100% pass rate (6/6 features) via testing agent (iteration_131.json).

### Key Endpoints:
- `POST /api/admin/celebrate/seed-from-excel` — Seeds 93 products + generates AI images
- `POST /api/product-box/products` — Create new product (no auth required)
- `POST /api/service-box/services` — Create new service (no auth required)

---

---

## ✅ SESSION 30c — PillarServicesTab Bug Fix (Mar 15, 2026)

**Bug:** Celebrate Services tab (PillarServicesTab) was showing 255 services instead of 15.
**Root cause:** Component fetched ALL 1100+ services and used keyword matching ("birthday", "party", "event") to filter — flooding every pillar tab with unrelated services.
**Fix:** Changed to use `?pillar=celebrate` API parameter (exact match only). Removed the `getPillarKeywords()` function entirely.
**Result:** Celebrate shows 15, dine shows 9, stay shows 9, care shows 30, travel shows 11 — exactly what's assigned in each pillar.

---



### What Was Done:
1. **"Generate AI Image" in Product Box** — Added to `ProductBoxEditor.jsx` Media tab. Calls synchronous `POST /api/admin/products/{id}/generate-image` → saves to Cloudinary, returns URL immediately (like ServiceBox does).
2. **"Generate AI Image" in Bundle editor** — Added to `CelebrateManager.jsx` bundle edit modal. Calls `POST /api/admin/celebrate/bundles/{id}/generate-image`.
3. **Active/Inactive toggle in PillarServicesTab** — Each service row now has a clickable green/gray toggle button to activate/deactivate the service. Plus a "Show All / Active Only" filter button.
4. **Two new backend endpoints:** `POST /api/admin/products/{id}/generate-image` and `POST /api/admin/celebrate/bundles/{id}/generate-image` — both synchronous, return Cloudinary URL.
5. **Testing:** 100% pass rate (21/21 backend + 4/4 frontend) via testing agent.

---


**93 products from Celebrate_ProductCatalogue_SEED.xlsx seeded into DB with AI images**

### What Was Done:
1. **Product Catalog Audit** — Parsed `Celebrate_ProductCatalogue_SEED.xlsx` (94 products across 8 pillars). Found only 1 already in DB. 93 missing.
2. **Created `backend/celebrate_excel_seeder.py`** — New seeder with all 93 products including SKUs (FF-001 to HW-011), descriptions, subtitles, mira_tags, soul_signals, shopify_tags, and AI image prompts.
3. **New Admin Endpoints:**
   - `POST /api/admin/celebrate/seed-from-excel` — Seeds + generates AI images
   - `GET /api/admin/celebrate/excel-seed-status` — Live progress status
4. **AI Image Generation** — All 93 products generated AI images via Cloudinary (0 failures).
5. **Admin Panel Updated** — `ProductGeneratorPanel.jsx` now has "Excel Catalog Seed" tab with live progress, pillar counts, and live image grid.
6. **All 20 Pillar Tabs Now Populated:**
   - Previously empty/low: enrichment(1→5), walking(1→4), adventure(1→3), venue(1→2), portraits(3→6+)
   - All other tabs already had products and now have Excel additions too

### Excel Products Summary:
| Pillar | SKU Prefix | Count |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Food & Flavour | FF-001 to FF-014 | 14 |
| Play & Joy | PJ-001 to PJ-014 | 14 |
| Social & Friends | SF-001 to SF-012 | 11 |
| Adventure & Move | AM-001 to AM-010 | 10 |
| Grooming & Beauty | GB-001 to GB-012 | 12 |
| Learning & Memory | LM-001 to LM-110 | 21 |
| Health & Wellness | HW-001 to HW-011 | 11 |
| **Total** | | **93** |

### Production Deploy Instructions:
1. Deploy preview → production
2. Run: `POST /api/admin/celebrate/seed-from-excel` (admin auth required) to seed products in production
3. Monitor: `GET /api/admin/celebrate/excel-seed-status` for image generation progress

---

## ✅ SESSION 29 — AI Personalization Tested + Celebrate Production Parity (Mar 15, 2026)
**All celebrate page changes verified ready for production deployment**

### What Was Done:
1. **Backend verified healthy** — lint warnings are non-critical warnings (F811/F841/F841), server starts fine
2. **AI Personalization tested** — `GET /api/products/soul-ranked?category=X&pet_id=Y` working end-to-end:
   - Mojo (Indie, peanut butter fan) → "Peanut Pup Prints" top cake (score=85)
   - Mystique (Shih Tzu) → "Festive Cake Pops" top cake (score=65) — different result = personalization works
3. **Service illustrations fixed** — ran fix-celebrate-data: all 15 celebrate services now use `res.cloudinary.com` URLs, 0 Unsplash
4. **Confirmed production parity checklist:**
   - ✅ /celebrate → /celebrate-soul redirect (App.js line 539)
   - ✅ toStrArray() crash fix for Food & Flavour pillar
   - ✅ fix-celebrate-data endpoint works (`POST /api/admin/fix-celebrate-data?password=lola4304`)
   - ✅ Soul-ranked products endpoint at `/api/products/soul-ranked`
5. **Documentation updated** — complete-documentation.html, CHANGELOG.md, PRD.md

### Production Deploy Instructions:
1. Deploy preview → production
2. Run: `POST https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/fix-celebrate-data?password=lola4304`
3. Verify celebrate page loads with pet selected, pillars show products

---

## ✅ SESSION 28 — Celebrate Page Design Quality Pass (Mar 2026)
**Improved font sizes, spacing, and mobile experience across celebrate page**

### Changes Made:
1. **SoulCelebrationPillars.jsx** — Pillar cards: icon 28→36px, title 14→16px, tagline 12→13px, badge 11→12px, card padding+radius increased, section header clamp(1.5rem→2rem), gap `gap-2.5`→`gap-3 md:gap-4`
2. **SoulPillarExpanded.jsx** — Product cards: image 80→120px, name 12→14px, price 13→15px. Panel header 18→20px, tabs 12→13px
3. **ProductDetailModal.jsx** — Proper iOS bottom sheet on mobile (slides from bottom, drag handle), image 224→256px, action buttons py-4 fontSize 16


## ✅ SESSION 27 COMPLETE — Production Fix Panel + Compare Tool (Mar 2026)

**Status: Complete — Admin now has zero-deployment production fix buttons and live preview↔production compare**

### What Was Built:
1. **New backend endpoint** `/api/admin/fix-pet-string-data` — converts pet soul data string→array (fixes Food & Flavour crash)
2. **Updated `/api/admin/fix-celebrate-data`** — now also fixes pet soul string data in one call
3. **"🚀 FIX PROD DATA" button** in admin dashboard CONFIG row — calls thedoggycompany.com API directly from browser
4. **"🔀 COMPARE" button** in admin dashboard CONFIG row — fetches live stats from both environments
5. **Preview ↔ Production Compare Panel** — table showing collection counts with diff + sync status
6. **Production Fix Panel** in CelebrateManager Settings tab — granular fix buttons with results display

### Confirmed Out-of-Sync (from COMPARE as of Mar 2026):
| Collection | Preview | Production | Diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| Products | 3,860 | 4,258 | +398 (prod has more Shopify products) |
| Services | 1,115 | 1,120 | +5 |
| Members | 9 | 6 | -3 |
| Orders | 11 | 0 | -11 |

### Action Required:
1. Deploy this preview → production (one time)
2. Click "🚀 FIX PROD DATA" to fix service illustrations + pet soul string data
3. Click "🔀 COMPARE" after deploy to verify sync

---

## ✅ SESSION 26 COMPLETE — Production Celebrate Page Fixes (Mar 2026)

**Status: Partial (data fixes live; crash fix + sort order pending deployment)**

### Fixes Applied (No Deployment Required - DB Fixes):
1. **Service Illustrations Restored**: All 8/8 celebrate concierge services now have proper `static.prod-images` illustration URLs (previously showing Unsplash stock photos)
2. **AI-generated rope/toy products deactivated**: Removed 3 AI-generated toy products (Birthday Rope Tug, Birthday Squeaky Balls, Hide & Seek Plush) from production listings
3. **AI-generated cake products deactivated**: Removed 3 bad AI-generated cakes (Peanut Butter, Chicken, Salmon) - 104 real Shopify cakes now showing
4. **fix-celebrate-data endpoint added**: New admin endpoint that bulk-fixes service illustrations + product image_url fields in one shot

### Fixes In Preview Code (Needs Deployment to Production):
1. **Food & Flavour crash fix**: `SoulPillarExpanded.jsx` — Added `toStrArray()` helper to handle string vs array for `favorite_treats` and `food_allergies` fields. Production pet data stores these as strings (`"liver, cheese"`) not arrays. This causes `TypeError: .map is not a function`.
2. **Product sort order**: Changed from `ai_image_generated: -1` (AI first) to `shopify_id: -1` (Shopify first). Real products with real photos show at the top.
3. **Master sync image_url fix**: Master sync step 8 now updates both `image` AND `image_url` for services.

### Action Required:
- **DEPLOY preview to production** to activate the crash fix and sort order change
- After deployment, call: `curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/fix-celebrate-data?password=lola4304"`

---

### Hook Rewritten: `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useResizeMobile.js`
- **Single export:** `useResizeMobile(breakpoint = 641)` — observes `document.body` via ResizeObserver, 150ms debounce, returns just `isMobile` (boolean)
- **No containerRef needed** — hook is self-contained, one line to use
- **Backward-compat alias:** `useViewportMobile = useResizeMobile` for any old imports
- Full SSR safety, full cleanup on unmount

### Applied To (P0):
| Component | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| BirthdayBoxBuilder.jsx | `const [containerRef, isMobile] = useResizeMobile(640)` + ref on backdrop | `const isMobile = useResizeMobile()` |
| BirthdayBoxBrowseDrawer.jsx | `const [containerRef, isMobile] = useResizeMobile(640)` + ref on backdrop | `const isMobile = useResizeMobile()` |
| MiraChatWidget.jsx | `const isMobile = useViewportMobile(640)` | `const isMobile = useResizeMobile()` |
| ConciergeIntakeModal.jsx | No hook, no responsive layout | `const isMobile = useResizeMobile()` + bottom-sheet on mobile |
| WallUploadModal.jsx | No hook, no responsive layout | `const isMobile = useResizeMobile()` + bottom-sheet on mobile |

### Mobile Layout for ConciergeIntakeModal & WallUploadModal:
- Mobile (< 641px): `alignItems: flex-start`, `padding: 88px 0 0`, `borderRadius: 20px 20px 0 0` (bottom-sheet style)
- Desktop: centered, `padding: 16px`, `borderRadius: 20px`

---

## ✅ SESSION 25 COMPLETE — /dine Soul Page Phase 1 (Mar 2026)

**90% pass rate (iteration_129). PATCH→PUT critical fix applied. All visual/UX features pass.**

### Build Order Followed (as specified)
1. TummyProfile (data spine) → 2. DineDimensions → 3. MiraMealPick → 4. GuidedNutritionPaths → 5. PetFriendlySpots → 6. DiningConciergeServices

### New Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `components/dine/DineHero.jsx` | Amber/terracotta gradient hero, soul chips, Mira quote |
| `components/dine/DineTabBar.jsx` | Eat & Nourish / Dine Out tabs |
| `components/dine/TummyProfile.jsx` | Data spine: Loves/Avoid/Goal/Health cells, editable nutrition_goal |
| `components/dine/DineDimensions.jsx` | 5 dimension cards with glow/dim/incomplete states |
| `components/dine/DineDimensionExpanded.jsx` | Portal expansion panel, replicates SoulPillarExpanded |
| `components/dine/MiraMealPick.jsx` | Templated rules engine (breed+age+weight+allergies+goal) |
| `components/dine/GuidedNutritionPaths.jsx` | 6 paths, 3 surfaced by Mira scoring |
| `components/dine/PetFriendlySpots.jsx` | Google Places via /api/nearby/places |
| `components/dine/DiningConciergeServices.jsx` | 4 concierge cards + dark CTA |
| `pages/DineSoulPage.jsx` | Main page, wired to /dine route directly |

### Backend Changes
- `models.py`: Added `nutrition_goal: Optional[str]` to `PetProfileCreate` + `PetProfileUpdate`

### Key Technical Decisions
- `nutrition_goal` defaults to `'maintenance'` when `null/undefined`
- `age_years == null` → defaults to `adult` life stage (not puppy)
- `weight == null` → defaults to `medium` size
- Health conditions handled as arrays or strings safely
- All fixed overlays use `useResizeMobile()` hook (bottom-sheet on mobile)
- `/dine` route replaced immediately (no `/dine-soul` detour — clean URL from day one)

### Pre-deploy Checklist (celebrate cleanup)
- [ ] Delete CelebratePage.jsx, update sub-category redirects to /celebrate-soul
- [ ] Add canonical tag to /celebrate-soul: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://thedoggycompany.com/celebrate" />`
- [ ] Update nav links from /celebrate-soul → /celebrate
- [ ] Sitemap: remove /celebrate-soul, confirm /celebrate is listed

### Upcoming
- (P1) Add Mira widget page-aware context for /dine (opening lines + chips)
- (P1) Seed dine product catalog (daily-meals, treats, supplements, fresh-frozen, homemade categories)
- (P1) /stay pillar — same architecture
- (P2) Soul builder steps — add useResizeMobile

---

**95% pass rate from testing agent (iteration_128). All components verified except PillarSoulModal UI (test pet has 100% soul score — code confirmed correct).**

### /celebrate → /celebrate-soul Redirect (Step 1)
- `<Navigate to="/celebrate-soul" replace />` added for `/celebrate` route in App.js
- `/celebrate-soul` added to Mira `hiddenPaths` list (prevents duplicate widget)
- Sub-category routes (`/celebrate/cakes` etc.) now route directly to `/celebrate-soul`
- **Step 2 (48h later):** Delete `CelebratePage.jsx` and update sub-category redirects to point directly to `/celebrate-soul`

### useResizeMobile Applied to P1/P2 Components
| Component | Change |
|---|---|
| WallLightbox.jsx | Added hook + mobile top-anchor + `borderRadius: 20px 20px 0 0` |
| PillarSoulModal.jsx | Added hook + `items-start pt-20` on mobile |
| ProductDetailModal.jsx | Added hook + `paddingTop: 88px` + bottom-sheet corners |
| DoggyServiceDesk.jsx | Migrated `window.addEventListener('resize')` → `useResizeMobile(768)` |

## ✅ SESSION 22 COMPLETE — ResizeObserver + useEffect Cleanup (Mar 2026)

**12/12 tests passing. iPad rotation + Chrome DevTools verified.**

### Hook Created: `/app/frontend/src/hooks/useResizeMobile.js`
- `useResizeMobile(breakpoint)` — callback ref pattern, attaches ResizeObserver to modal container, 150ms debounce, cleanup on unmount + element change
- `useViewportMobile(breakpoint)` — observes `document.documentElement`, for persistent panels (Mira)

### Applied To:
| Component | Hook Used | Ref Attached To |
|---|---|---|
| BirthdayBoxBuilder.jsx | useResizeMobile(640) | backdrop motion.div (position:fixed inset:0) |
| BirthdayBoxBrowseDrawer.jsx | useResizeMobile(640) | drawer-backdrop motion.div |
| MiraChatWidget.jsx | useViewportMobile(640) | document.documentElement |

### useEffect Cleanup Fixes (MiraChatWidget):
- pillar visit + fetchQuickPrompts + fetchMiraContext → `cancelled` flag
- fetchPets → `cancelled` flag  
- fetchPetIntelligence → `cancelled` flag

### Verified Behaviour:
- 1024px → modal centered; 375px → modal top-aligned (110px from top); rotation back to 1024 → centered again
- Mira: 1024px → right panel (420px); 375px → full-width top:105px
- No zombie setState warnings after rapid open/close × 5

**User reported 4 issues on their Apple phone. All fixed, 100% verified.**

| # | Issue | Fix | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Guided Paths "stuck" — close button scrolls out of view on mobile | `createPortal` renders close pill at `document.body` (escapes framer-motion CSS transform containment). Button appears at `bottom: 90px` above mobile nav bar | ✅ 375px + 390px |
| 2 | Service cards: 4 cramped columns on mobile | `.service-grid-responsive` on mobile → `display:flex, overflow-x:auto, min-width:220px` (horizontal scroll carousel) | ✅ 375px + 390px |
| 3 | Mira widget hidden behind sticky header | Widget: `top: var(--mira-top-offset, 105px)` + `bottom: 70px` on mobile (was `h-[85dvh] bottom-0`) | ✅ 375px + 390px |
| 4 | Fonts too small | SoulCelebrationPillars: name 13→14px, tagline 11→12px, badge 10→11px; section headings use `clamp()` | ✅ 390px |

---

| CelebrateCategoryStrip labels at 10px (below 12px min) | MEDIUM | fontSize 10 → 11, maxWidth 72 → 80 |
| Pet selector strip no scroll hint | MEDIUM | Right-edge fade gradient (bg-gradient-to-l from-slate-900) when pets.length > 2 |
| 'Social Butterfly' badge wrapping to 2 lines | MINOR | whitespace-nowrap + text-ellipsis on badge |
| '♥ Mira knows' text at 11px | MINOR | text-[12px] |

---

### WHAT IS IN PROGRESS:
**P0: Wire BirthdayBoxOrdersAdmin into AgentPortal.jsx — ✅ COMPLETE (Session 15)**
- Full 3-column layout: Order List | 6-Slot Manifest (checkboxes) | Action Panel (WhatsApp + Status + Notes + Log)
- Status transitions with server-side gates (allergy confirmation gate, slot assembly gate)
- WhatsApp pre-filled contact button + Email contact button
- Notes panel with instant append (no reload needed)
- Nav tab shows red badge with count of NEW orders
- 28 orders in DB, backend endpoints all verified
- Allergy confirmation gate server-side enforced
- Slot-by-slot assembly checkboxes with DB persistence
- Order log (audit trail) collapsible panel
- Personalisation panel (bandana name, cake message, delivery date, address)
- `BirthdayBoxOrdersAdmin.jsx` — FULLY BUILT (3-panel layout, status transitions, allergy banner, personalisation editing) ✅
- Backend endpoints — ALL BUILT (`GET/PATCH /api/admin/birthday-box-orders/*`) ✅
- Import already in `AgentPortal.jsx` ✅
- **28 birthday box orders exist in DB** ✅
- **MISSING:**
  - Render block `{activeTab === 'birthday_box_orders' && <BirthdayBoxOrdersAdmin />}` in AgentPortal content area
  - `birthday_box_orders` permission NOT in `AGENT_PERMISSIONS` list in server.py
  - No agent exists in `agents` collection (empty) — login fails
- **Action:** Add render block + permission + seed test agent → test full flow

### WHAT SPEC DOC SAYS (ServiceDesk_BirthdayBoxOrders_SPEC.docx — Full canonical spec):
See "Service Desk Full Spec" section above in this PRD. Key phases:
- Phase 1A/1B/1C: DONE (read-only manifest, allergy banner, status transitions)
- Phase 2A: PARTIALLY DONE (status PATCH exists, slot assembly PATCH missing)
- Phase 2B/2C: TODO (slot checkboxes UI, allergy gate enforcement)
- Phase 3: TODO (WhatsApp contact panel, notes, order log)
- Phase 4: TODO (delivery notifications)

---

### WHAT WAS BUILT:

#### 1. **BirthdayBoxBuilder.jsx** (NEW — COMPLETED ✅)
Multi-step modal opened via `openOccasionBoxBuilder` custom event.
- **Step 1:** All 6 slots displayed with Mira's picks, emoji, descriptions, allergy-safe/surprise badges
- **Step 2 (conditional):** Explicit allergy confirmation step — shown only if pet has allergies
  - Displays allergy profile, health slot detail, and confirmation checkbox
  - CTA disabled until checkbox is ticked
- **Step 3:** Success screen with Order ID and concierge handoff note
- Calls `POST /api/birthday-box/{petId}/build` (updated to use `get_all_allergies()`)
- "Browse all options" link → closes builder → opens Browse Drawer

#### 2. **BirthdayBoxBrowseDrawer.jsx** (NEW — COMPLETED ✅)
Right-side drawer per spec. Opened via `openBirthdayBoxBrowse` custom event.
- 480px desktop / 100vw mobile, slides from right (320ms)
- Mira bar with pulsating dot
- 5 tabs: Cakes | Toys & Joy | Style | Memory | Wellness
- Each tab: Mira's pick row + allergy banner + product grid (horizontal cards)
- Swap tracking: pills with Undo, swap count in bottom bar
- Bottom bar: whisper text + "Build {petName}'s Box →" (glows pink on swaps)
- "Build Box →" → closes drawer → opens BirthdayBoxBuilder with swaps

#### 3. **Backend Fix: build endpoint allergy check** (FIXED ✅)
`POST /api/birthday-box/{pet_id}/build` now uses `get_all_allergies()` for the allergy guard,
consistent with the preview endpoint.

#### 4. **CelebratePageNew.jsx Wiring** (UPDATED ✅)
- Both components mounted at bottom of page (event-driven)
- `handleBuildBox` passes `petId` in event detail
- `handleOpenBrowseDrawer` triggers browse with boxPreview context
- MiraBirthdayBox secondary button passes live `boxPreview` to browse handler

### Events Reference
| Event | Trigger | Detail |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `openOccasionBoxBuilder` | "Build {pet}'s Box" primary button | `{preset, petName, petId}` |
| `openBirthdayBoxBrowse` | "Birthday Box" secondary button | `{boxPreview, petName}` |

### TESTING RESULTS (Session 12 Final):
| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Builder Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 full flow | ✅ PASS |
| Step 3 Concierge Handoff screen — ticket ID, 6-slot summary, "What happens next" | ✅ PASS |
| "Not an e-commerce order" disclaimer | ✅ PASS |
| POST /api/birthday-box/{petId}/concierge-handoff — all 5 unified collections | ✅ PASS |
| Allergy guard (allergyConfirmed=False returns error) | ✅ PASS |
| Toast notification (Sonner Toaster fixed in App.js) | ✅ PASS (critical fix) |
| Mobile bottom sheet + drag handle | ✅ PASS |

**Backend tests:** 14/14 passed  
**Frontend tests:** 100% verified  

### Critical Bug Fixed by Testing Agent:
- **Sonner Toaster not mounted in App.js** — ALL toast notifications were silently failing across the entire app. Fixed by adding `<SonnerToaster />` to App.js.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ALLERGY DATA FIX (Session 11)

### THE PROBLEM
Mojo has chicken allergy but system showed "Chicken birthday cake"

### ROOT CAUSE
Allergy data stored in MULTIPLE locations in pet document:
- `health_data.allergies: ['chicken']`
- `doggy_soul_answers.food_allergies: ['chicken']`
- `health.allergies: ['chicken']`
- `insights.key_flags.allergy_list: ['chicken']`

But code only checked:
- `pet.get("allergies")` → empty []
- `pet.get("allergy1")` → None

### THE FIX
Created `get_all_allergies(pet)` function that checks ALL locations:
```python
def get_all_allergies(pet: dict) -> list:
    all_allergies = set()
    
    # Direct fields
    if pet.get("allergies"): all_allergies.update(...)
    if pet.get("allergy1"): all_allergies.add(...)
    
    # health_data.allergies
    health_data = pet.get("health_data", {})
    if health_data.get("allergies"): all_allergies.update(...)
    
    # health.allergies
    health = pet.get("health", {})
    if health.get("allergies"): all_allergies.update(...)
    
    # doggy_soul_answers.food_allergies
    soul_answers = pet.get("doggy_soul_answers", {})
    if soul_answers.get("food_allergies"): all_allergies.update(...)
    
    # insights.key_flags.allergy_list
    insights = pet.get("insights", {})
    key_flags = insights.get("key_flags", {})
    if key_flags.get("allergy_list"): all_allergies.update(...)
    
    return list(all_allergies)
```

### RESULT
- **Before:** "Chicken birthday cake" ❌
- **After:** "Salmon birthday cake, allergy-safe" ✅

## 🔄 SESSION 11 SPEC — PillarSoulModal + Master Sync + Product Modal (March 14, 2026)

### WHAT WAS BUILT:

#### 1. **PillarSoulModal Implementation** (COMPLETED ✅)
When a pillar is clicked and the pet's profile is **missing information** for that specific pillar, a modal appears with **4-6 contextual questions** to help enrich the pet's soul data.

**Flow:**
1. User clicks a pillar → System checks if pet has enough data for that pillar
2. If data is incomplete → Show `PillarSoulModal` with pillar-specific questions
3. User answers questions → Backend updates `doggy_soul_answers` + recalculates soul score
4. Updates Mira's memory (`learned_facts` array) → She now "knows" more about the pet
5. **OUTCOME:** Immediately able to generate dynamic concierge suggestions with the new data

**New Backend Endpoint:**
| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/pets/{pet_id}/pillar-soul-update` | PATCH | JWT | Update soul answers from pillar questions |

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
  "pillar": "food",
  "answers": {"favorite_treats": ["Salmon", "Chicken"]},
  "learned_facts": ["[Food & Flavour] What flavours does Mojo love? → Salmon, Chicken"],
  "summary": "Mojo food preferences updated via soul modal"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "pet": {...updated pet object...},
  "new_score": 100.0,
  "score_tier": "soul_master",
  "pillar": "food",
  "facts_added": 1
}
```

#### 2. **Master Sync for AI Products** (COMPLETED ✅)
On backend startup, automatically seeds celebrate products ensuring all 8 pillars have items in "Shop" tab.

**Implementation:** Added Step 12/12 to `master_sync_on_startup()`:
- Imports `seed_celebrate_products` from `celebrate_product_generator.py`
- Seeds 59 new products across pillar categories
- Syncs with Cloudinary for proper images
- **Result:** Products now available in all pillar Shop tabs

**Seeded Product Counts:**
| Category | Count | Pillar |
|---|---|---|
| puzzle_toys | 9 | Learning & Mind |
| party_kits | 8 | Social & Friends |
| memory_books | 6 | Love & Memory |
| portraits | 5 | Love & Memory |
| supplements | 11 | Health & Wellness |
| party_accessories | 12 | Social & Friends / Play & Joy |

#### 3. **ProductDetailModal** (NEW ✅)
Full product modal with:
- Product image, name, description
- Variant selector (if multiple variants)
- Quantity selector (for products, not services)
- **Add to Cart** button (for products with price)
- **Request via Concierge** button (for services / items without price)
- Pillar-colored theme

**Service Detection:** Items automatically route to concierge if:
- No price / price = 0
- Category is `grooming` or `portraits`
- Name contains "photoshoot", "booking", "session"

#### 4. **Concierge Flow for Services** (VERIFIED ✅)
All service-type items in Grooming & Memory pillars:
- Display "Concierge" instead of price
- Show "Book 👑" button
- Clicking triggers `POST /api/concierge/pillar-request`
- Toast notification with ticket ID on success

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/backend/server.py` — Added endpoint + Master Sync step
- `/app/frontend/src/components/celebrate/SoulCelebrationPillars.jsx` — Rendered PillarSoulModal
- `/app/frontend/src/components/celebrate/SoulPillarExpanded.jsx` — Added ProductDetailModal integration
- `/app/frontend/src/components/celebrate/ProductDetailModal.jsx` — NEW component

### PRODUCT AUDIT RESULTS:

## THE VISION
> "We are not a commerce platform. We are a Pet Operating System. The Soul comes first."

The world's first soul-driven Pet Operating System. Every dog has a personality, lifestyle, health story — the Soul. The platform captures this and uses it to power every recommendation, every Mira response, and every concierge interaction.

**3,777 products in DB. 221+ API endpoints. 51 Soul Questions. 14 Pillars.**

## ✅ SESSION 8 COMPLETED (March 14, 2026) — TESTED ✅

### FEATURE 1 — Soul Score Constant Glow (COMPLETED ✅)
- Replaced `key={score}` spring-remount with `useAnimation()` imperative control + `useEffect` trigger
- Added `motion.span` with `textShadow` cycling `16px→48px→16px` glow, `repeat: Infinity` — NEVER stops
- Score changes: smooth tween pop via `scoreControls.start({ scale: [1,1.12,1] })` — no bounce

### FEATURE 2 — PetWrap Teaser in Mira's Picks (COMPLETED ✅)
- `PetWrapTeaser` component renders in `miras-picks` section of `CelebrateContentModal`
- Loads from `GET /api/wrapped/generate/{petId}` (API now exposes `archetype_name`, `archetype_emoji`, `soul_score` at top level)
- Shows: pet name, year, soul score %, archetype, "View Full Wrap" CTA + Share button

### FEATURE 3 — Celebrate-Context Soul Questions (COMPLETED ✅)
- Backend: `GET /api/pet-soul/profile/{petId}/quick-questions?context=celebrate` added
- Priority order: `celebration_preferences` (if unanswered) → `taste_treat` folder → motivation/activity → others
- Frontend: CelebrateContentModal passes `?context=celebrate&limit=5` to soul questions

### FEATURE 4 — Occasion Countdown Card (COMPLETED ✅)
- `OccasionCountdownCard` renders at TOP of Mira's Picks
- Checks `pet.birthday`, `pet.gotcha_date`, and soul-answered celebration_preferences (Diwali, Holi, Christmas etc.)
- Gold styling when within 7 days, purple when 8-45 days, shows "TODAY" badge
- Holi/festival dates mapped to approximate annual dates

### FEATURE 5 — Archetype-Based Imagined Products (COMPLETED ✅)
- 6 archetypes mapped: gentle_aristocrat, wild_explorer, velcro_baby, social_butterfly, foodie_gourmet, zen_philosopher
- Always includes at least 1 archetype card: `archetypeSlots = Math.max(1, Math.min(2, 5 - imaginaryProducts.length))`
- Total limit expanded to 5 imagined products

### FEATURE 6 — Mira Memory Loop (COMPLETED ✅)
- `celebrate_routes.py`: When concierge request created with `pet_id`, writes to `pets.learned_facts`
- Format: `{type, category, product_name, request_type, request_id, date}`
- Mira chat backend already reads `learned_facts` in system prompt via `get_pet_context_pack`

### BUG FIX — Text Duplication (COMPLETED ✅)
- "salmon treats treats" text duplication fixed: `cleanFood` properly strips "treats/cake/food" suffixes

---

## ✅ SESSION 7 FIXES (March 14, 2026) — TESTED ✅

### FEATURE 1 — Soul Score Constant Glow (P0)
**Problem:** The `key={score}` on the score number causes it to re-mount and re-animate with `scale: 1.4` on every update — creating a "bounce" effect. After answering, the score jumps forward and back.
**Fix:**
- Remove `key={score}` re-mount strategy
- Replace spring animation with `@keyframes pulse-glow` CSS that runs INFINITELY
- Score always glows (`text-shadow` pulse animation, never stops)
- Score changes counter-animate with a smooth `useSpring` value (no bounce)
- File: `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — SoulQuestionsSection component

### FEATURE 2 — PetWrap Mini-Card in Mira's Picks (P1)
**What:** PetWrap (`/wrapped/:petId`) is a beautiful 5-card pet year-in-review (Cover, Soul Score, Mira Moments, Pillars, Closing). It already exists. User wants it visible NEXT TO the soul section inside the Mira's Picks modal.
**Design:**
- Compact PetWrap teaser card: shows cover card info (soul score, archetype, year)
- "View Full Wrap" → opens `/wrapped/:petId` in new tab
- Share button using `navigator.share` or clipboard fallback
- Dynamically loads from `/api/wrapped/generate/{petId}`
- File: `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — inside `category === 'miras-picks'` section

### FEATURE 3 — Celebrate-Context Soul Questions (P1) ← KEY FEATURE
**What:** When in the celebrate modal, soul questions should be CELEBRATE-FIRST. Current behavior: random from all 9 folders. Target: celebrate-relevant folders first.

**Celebrate-Relevant Folders (PRIORITY ORDER):**
1. `taste_treat` → "What protein does {pet} love?" → Auto-generates cake/treat imagined cards
2. `celebration_preferences` question → "Which celebrations do you want to remember?" → Occasions setup
3. `toy_play` (if exists) / `identity_temperament` motivation → toy gift imaginations
4. Other folders after these

**Backend change:** `GET /api/pet-soul/profile/{petId}/quick-questions?context=celebrate&limit=5`
- When `context=celebrate`: move `taste_treat` + `celebration_preferences` questions to the TOP of the selection
- File: `pet_soul_routes.py` — `get_quick_questions` endpoint

**Frontend change after answering a celebrate question:**
- The `onAnswered` callback fires → `onRefreshMiraCards()` runs
- Re-generates Mira Imagines cards based on NEW soul data
- NEW IMAGINATION TYPES (not just cakes): toys, accessories, hampers, treats, activity kits
  - `favorite_protein = "Chicken"` → "Chicken Celebration Cake" + "Chicken Jerky Hamper"
  - `favorite_treats = ["Cakes", "Jerky"]` → imagined product cards for those types
  - `motivation_type = "Toys/play"` → "Custom Fetch Toy Gift Set" imagined card
  - Soul archetype `wild_explorer` → "Adventure Birthday Hamper" imagined card
- All imagined products → CONCIERGE FLOW (not add-to-cart)
- File: `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — `generateMiraImagines` function (EXPAND beyond cakes)

### FEATURE 4 — Occasion-Based Cards in Mira's Picks (P1)
**What:** 
- Check if `doggy_soul_answers.celebration_preferences` is answered for the pet
- If answered with ["Birthday", "Diwali" etc.] + pet has `birthday` or `gotcha_date` → show special occasion countdown card in Mira's Picks: "Mojo's birthday is in 15 days — here's what Mira prepared 🎂"
- If NOT answered → `celebration_preferences` question appears FIRST in soul questions (already handled by FEATURE 3)
- Occasion types: Birthday, Gotcha Day, Diwali, Holi, Christmas, New Year, Valentine's Day, Raksha Bandhan, Rakhi, Independence Day, Easter, Eid

**Where in UI:** At TOP of `miras-picks` section, before imagined cards
**File:** `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — new `OccasionCountdownCard` component

### FEATURE 5 — Mira Memory Loop: Product Selections → learned_facts (P2)
**What:** When a pet parent sends a concierge request (e.g., "Salmon Delight Cake"), store this as a `learned_fact` on the pet.
**Backend:** In the celebrate concierge request endpoint → add:
```python
await db.pets.update_one(
  {"id": pet_id},
  {"$push": {"learned_facts": {
    "type": "concierge_request", 
    "category": "celebrate",
    "product_name": product_name,
    "occasion": occasion,
    "date": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
  }}}
)
```
**Mira already uses `learned_facts`** in system prompt (verified — `mira_routes.py` line 3088+)
**Result:** Next time user opens Mira widget, she says: "Last time you asked about {product_name} for {petName} — want to revisit that?"
**File:** `celebrate_routes.py` — concierge request endpoint

### FEATURE 6 — Soul Archetype → Imagined Products (P2)
**What:** The soul archetype engine (`/api/soul-archetype/pet/{petId}`) derives personality from soul answers. This should influence what Mira imagines:
- `gentle_aristocrat` → Premium/elegant items: "Luxury Birthday Hamper", "Velvet Bow Tie"
- `wild_explorer` → Adventure items: "Adventure Birthday Kit", "Rope Tug Gift Set"
- `velcro_baby` → Comfort items: "Comfort Snuggle Pack", "Mom's Scent Toy"
- `social_butterfly` → Party items: "Pawty Decoration Kit", "Group Treat Bag"
- `foodie_gourmet` → Food items: "Gourmet Tasting Kit", "Custom Recipe Cake"
**File:** `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — `generateMiraImagines` function — add archetype-based imaginations

---

## ✅ SESSION 7 FIXES (March 14, 2026) — TESTED ✅
### P0 — Soul Question Cards UI (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Problem**: SoulQuestionCard had light blue/white theme (`rgba(68,136,255,0.06)`) — unreadable on white modal
- **Fix**: Restored **deep purple dark theme**: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #12003A 0%, #2D0060 100%)`, purple borders (`rgba(196,77,255,0.35)`), white text, purple/pink CTAs
- **File**: `CelebrateContentModal.jsx` — SoulQuestionCard component + SoulQuestionsSection component

### P0 — Soul Score Display Enhancement (COMPLETED ✅)
- Score counter: 38px → **64px** font size with spring animation + glow effect (`text-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(196,77,255,0.55)`)
- Added session delta badge: "+X% this session"
- Added animated progress bar (purple → gold when ≥80%)
- Section uses deep purple gradient header matching hero/MiraImaginesCard

### P1 — Admin Panel Auth + Robustness (COMPLETED ✅)
- **Root cause**: `GET /api/admin/products` used `verify_admin` (Basic Auth ONLY) → JWT Bearer tokens rejected → 0 products
- **Backend fix**: Changed to `verify_admin_auth` (accepts both Basic Auth AND JWT Bearer)
- **Frontend fix 1**: `Promise.all` → `Promise.allSettled` in `fetchAllData` — one failure no longer kills entire load
- **Frontend fix 2**: Added fallback fetch (public `/api/products` by category) when admin endpoint fails
- **Frontend fix 3**: `showInactive` default `false` → `true` — admin now shows ALL products including inactive party accessories
- **Verified**: Party accessories (Pawty Hat Set, Happy Birthday Tiara etc.) + celebration_addons showing in admin ✅

   - **Mobile**: Bottom sheet (93vh, drag handle)
   - `birthday-cakes` → `cakes` (111 actual TDB bakery cakes ✅ was wrongly pointing to `celebration`)
   - `miras-picks` → `cakes` fetched then **breed-filtered client-side** (Indie dog gets Indie cakes) ✅

     - `addedCount` increments on every `addToCart` custom event while modal is open; resets on category switch

5. **Admin CelebrateManager** — loads 308+ products, category dropdown has celebration/frozen-treats/party_accessories

### PRODUCT COUNTS — CELEBRATE UNIVERSE
| Category | DB Name | Count |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Birthday / Celebration Cakes (actual TDB cakes) | **cakes** | 111 |
| Celebration packages/kits (NOT in birthday-cakes tab) | celebration | 106 |
| Breed Cakes | breed-cakes | 42 |
| Gift Hampers | hampers | 37 |
| Pupcakes & Dognuts | dognuts | 30 |

| Party Kits | party_kits | 4 |
| **Total in strip tabs** | | **~279 products** |
| Celebrate Bundles (separate collection) | celebrate_bundles | 6 |

### KEY DATA INSIGHT ⚠️
`cakes` (111) = actual TDB bakery cake products (beautiful illustrated cakes)
`celebration` (106) = celebration packages/kits/bundles by breed — NOT birthday cakes
NEVER use `celebration` for the Birthday Cakes tab. Use `cakes`.

### PRODUCT COUNTS — CELEBRATE UNIVERSE
| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| celebration (Birthday Cakes) | 106 |
| breed-cakes | 42 |

### PRODUCT COUNTS — CELEBRATE UNIVERSE (Confirmed Mar 13, 2026)
| Category | DB Name | Count | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Birthday / Celebration Cakes | celebration | 106 | ✅ Strip tab "Birthday Cakes" |
| Breed Cakes | breed-cakes | 42 | ✅ Strip tab "Breed Cakes" |
| Gift Hampers | hampers | 37 | ✅ Strip tab "Gift Hampers" |
| Pupcakes & Dognuts | dognuts | 30 | ✅ Strip tab "Pupcakes" |

### ✅ COMPLETED — AI Image Generation for Party & Accessories (Mar 14, 2026)
1. **AI Image Generation** — 15 realistic product images generated using Cloudinary AI engine (GPT Image 1)
   - **Script:** `/app/backend/scripts/generate_party_accessory_images.py`
   - **Products:** Generic party items applicable across ALL breeds
   - **Storage:** `products_master` collection
   - **Visibility:** Party & Decor category tab shows 33 items with AI images first

### ✅ FIXED — Session 6 (Mar 15, 2026) — Critical Regression Restored
**Root Cause:** Previous session's cleanup script set `is_active: None` on all celebrate products, filtering them out.
**Fix Applied:**
- Re-activated 253 products: `breed-cakes`(42), `cakes`(111), `dognuts`(30), `frozen-treats`(24), `desi-treats`(7), `nut-butters`(6), `hampers`(37), `celebration`(106)
- Backend API `is_active` filter now also accepts `None`/`null` values (robustness)
- `getLovedFoods()` improved: handles both learned_facts formats (type:'loves' + category:'loves')
- `extractSoulTraits()` improved: cleaner, handles all fact formats, deduped

### ✅ Mira's Picks — Enhanced & Working (Mar 15, 2026)
- Food-based: Mojo loves "salmon treats" → "Salmon Delight Cake" imagined card
- Activity-based: "morning walks" → "Adventure Walk Party Pack"
- Soul onboarding: If no soul data → prompt card with "Help Mira Know Me"
- Works for ALL pets (Mojo, Mystique, any new pet)

### IN PROGRESS 🚧 — NEXT TASKS
1. **Replace `/celebrate` with `/celebrate-soul`** — once Aditya approves
2. **Standardize other pillar pages** — `/dine`, `/stay`, `/learn` using celebrate as template
3. **500 uncategorized products** — Admin needs to categorize or AI auto-categorize

---

## 🌟 MIRA IMAGINES CARD — FUTURE VISION (Product Research Engine)
> The MiraImaginesCard is a hidden gem — it's essentially a "dream item" that doesn't exist yet but Mira can will into existence.

### Current State
- Shows hypothetical products based on pet's loved foods (e.g., "Salmon Delight Cake")
- "Request a Quote" button → Concierge toast notification
- Max 3 imaginary cards per session

### Future Extension (P1)
**Extend MiraImaginesCard to ALL categories based on pet's soul profile:**
- If Mojo's soul mentions "loves swimming" → Mira imagines "Pool Day Party Kit"
- If pet loves car rides → Mira imagines "Road Trip Celebration Box"
- Every "Request a Quote" click creates a feedback loop → tells us exactly what products to build next
- **Mira becomes a product research engine** — user demand data for new product development

### Technical Implementation (Future)
```javascript
// In CelebrateContentModal.jsx - extend imaginedProducts generation
const generateSoulBasedImagines = (pet) => {
  const preferences = pet?.soul?.preferences || [];
  const activities = pet?.learned_facts?.filter(f => f.type === 'activity') || [];
  
  // Map soul data to imaginary products
  // "loves swimming" → "Pool Day Party Kit", "Pool Party Bandana Set"
  // "loves fetch" → "Ultimate Fetch Birthday Box"
  // This is the PRODUCT RESEARCH ENGINE
};
```

### Data Collection for Product Development
```javascript
// Track "Request a Quote" clicks
const trackImaginaryProductRequest = async (product, pet) => {
  await fetch('/api/mira/imaginary-requests', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      product_name: product.name,
      pet_breed: pet.breed,
      pet_soul_traits: pet.soul?.preferences,
      requested_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  });
  // This data tells us what to build next!
};
