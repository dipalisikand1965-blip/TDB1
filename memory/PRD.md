# Pet Life Operating System - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive "Pet Life Operating System" where every user or system-generated signal (click, search, voice command, form submission, etc.) must trigger a mandatory, non-negotiable **Unified Signal Flow**: 
**1. Notification → 2. Service Desk Ticket → 3. Unified Inbox Entry**

This flow must work across:
- All pillars (Care, Fit, Travel, Stay, Celebrate, Enjoy, Learn, Advisory, Paperwork, Dine, etc.)
- Mira AI conversations
- Search queries
- Product/service requests
- Booking confirmations

## What's Been Implemented (Session: Jan 29, 2026)

### ✅ SEV-1 Unified Flow Fix - RESOLVED
**Root Cause Found**: Multiple backend endpoints were NOT creating the full unified flow (Notification + Ticket + Inbox). They showed "success" to users but only created partial records.

**Fixed Endpoints**:
1. `/api/concierge/experience-request` - Now creates full unified flow
2. `/api/celebrate/requests` - Now creates full unified flow  
3. `/api/learn/request` - Now creates full unified flow
4. All pillar-specific request endpoints verified working

**Verification**: All requests now appear in Admin Panel → Notifications, Service Desk, and Unified Inbox.

### ✅ Mira AI Pillar Panel Links Fix
**Problem**: Suggestion buttons on pillar pages (Paperwork, Advisory, etc.) weren't working - they opened chat but didn't send the message.

**Fix**: Added `sendDirectMessage()` function to `MiraContextPanel.jsx` that directly sends messages to Mira API instead of relying on state updates + timeouts.

### ✅ Pet Soul Score Display Fix
**Problem**: Soul Score showing 0% for Mojo even though database had 37.8%.

**Fix**: Updated `load_pet_soul()` in `mira_routes.py` to include `soul_score` and `overall_score` fields in the response.

### ✅ Mira AI Quick Actions Fix
**Problem**: Quick action buttons in MiraAI.jsx widget weren't sending messages reliably.

**Fix**: Refactored `handleQuickAction()` to directly call the Mira API instead of using state + setTimeout hack.

## Pending Issues / Tomorrow's Tasks

### 🔴 P0 - Critical for Production

#### 1. Checkout Cart GST/Shipping Order
**Issue**: GST is calculated BEFORE shipping is added. Since GST should apply to shipping too, the order must be:
- Subtotal → Discount → **Shipping** → Taxable Amount → GST → Total

**Files to modify**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/UnifiedCheckout.jsx` (display order)
- `/app/backend/checkout_routes.py` (calculation logic - must include shipping in taxable amount)

#### 2. Mira Voice - Female Voice
**Requirement**: Mira AI should use a woman's voice for text-to-speech.

**Files to check**:
- `/app/frontend/src/components/MiraAI.jsx`
- `/app/frontend/src/components/MiraContextPanel.jsx`
- Look for `speechSynthesis` and voice selection

### 🟠 P1 - Important

1. **Stay Page Layout Redo** - Pet properties should be displayed on TOP of the page
2. **Pet Profile Crash for "Mynx"** - User reported crash when viewing pet profile
3. **Paw Points Display** - Incorrect display for specific user account
4. **Mobile UI Transformation** - Member Dashboard mobile optimization
5. **Service Booking Flow** - Mobile optimization

### 🟡 P2 - Backlog

1. **Razorpay Payments** - Reported as failing
2. **PDF Invoice Generation**
3. **Centralized Item Intelligence Form** - Full implementation
4. **Partner Portal** - B2B clients portal
