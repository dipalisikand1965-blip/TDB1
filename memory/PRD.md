## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Production Data Sync (READ THIS FIRST!)

### The Problem
Preview (Emergent) and Production (thedoggycompany.com) use **DIFFERENT MongoDB databases**:
- **Preview**: `mongodb://localhost:27017/pet-os-live-test_database`
- **Production**: MongoDB Atlas (different database entirely)

**Code deploys automatically, but DATA DOES NOT.** After any deployment that modifies data, you MUST sync manually.

### When to Sync
- After adding/modifying products, services, bundles, or guided paths
- After generating AI images for services
- When user reports "missing data" or "wrong images" on production
- After any seed script runs in preview

### Sync Endpoints (All require `?password=lola4304`)
```bash
# Clean duplicate services (run first)
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/cleanup-duplicate-services?password=lola4304"

# Fix missing service images
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/fix-service-images?password=lola4304"

# Bulk import products (use Python script for large syncs)
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/bulk-import-products?password=lola4304" -d '{"products": [...]}'

# Bulk import services
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/bulk-import-services?password=lola4304" -d '{"services": [...]}'

# Bulk import guided paths
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/bulk-import-guided-paths?password=lola4304" -d '{"paths": [...]}'

# Force full sync (runs all seeders)
curl -X POST "https://thedoggycompany.com/api/admin/force-full-sync?password=lola4304"
```

### Full Sync Script Location
`/app/backend/production_data_sync.py` - Run this for complete product/service sync

---

## ✅ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES - ALL RESOLVED

### 1. ~~Hardcoded Content in Frontend~~ - FULLY FIXED ✅
All guided paths and journey guides across ALL 4 pillars are now stored in the database and fetched via API:
- Created `/app/backend/guided_paths_routes.py` with full CRUD API
- Seeded 20 paths: 8 emergency, 4 advisory, 4 farewell, 4 adopt
- Integrated into Master Sync for automatic seeding on deployment
- **FarewellPage.jsx** - Fetches from `/api/guided-paths/farewell` ✅
- **AdoptPage.jsx** - Fetches from `/api/guided-paths/adopt` ✅
- **EmergencyPage.jsx** - Fetches from `/api/guided-paths/emergency` ✅ (NEW)
- **AdvisoryPage.jsx** - Fetches from `/api/guided-paths/advisory` ✅ (NEW)

### 2. ~~Farewell Page Product Recommendations~~ - FIXED ✅
- PersonalizedPicks now has pillar-specific fallback for sensitive pillars
- No generic products shown on farewell/adopt pages

### 3. ~~Service Category Cards missing Concierge~~ - FIXED ✅
- Farewell page service cards now have "Talk to Concierge" buttons
- Clicking opens the service modal with proper form
