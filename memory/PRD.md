## SESSION 9 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### 1. CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Login Redirect ✅
- **Issue:** After login on `/mira-demo`, users were redirected to `/dashboard` instead of back to `/mira-demo`
- **Root Cause:** `Login.jsx` hardcoded `navigate('/dashboard')` after successful login
- **Fix:** Updated `Login.jsx` to use `location.state?.from` (passed by ProtectedRoute) to redirect users back to their original destination
- **File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` (lines 1-30)
- **Impact:** This was blocking all access to the Pet OS UI - the `PetOSNavigation` was rendering correctly, but users couldn't see it because they were redirected away

### 2. Frontend Verified Working ✅
- **PetOSNavigation:** All 7 OS layer tabs visible (MOJO, TODAY, PICKS, SERVICES, INSIGHTS, LEARN, CONCIERGE®)
- **PICKS Panel:** Products and services displaying correctly with personalized recommendations
- **SERVICES Panel:** Service launchers (8 quick actions), empty state, notification icon all working
- **Soul Knowledge Ticker:** Displaying pet facts at top of page
- **Pet Avatar:** 63% SOUL score indicator visible

### 3. Backend APIs Verified ✅
- `POST /api/mira/os/understand-with-products` - Working, returns products + services
- `GET /api/os/services/launchers` - Returns 8 service launchers
- `GET /api/os/services/inbox` - Returns user tickets

---

## SESSION 8 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### 1. PICKS Bug Fixed ✅
- File: `/app/backend/scoring_logic.py` line 433
- Changed: `classification.pillar` → `classification.primary_pillar`
- Impact: Picks were returning 0 results due to attribute error

### 2. Unified Status Taxonomy ✅
Created `/app/backend/ticket_status_system.py`:
```
Canonical Statuses:
- draft, placed
- clarification_needed, options_ready, approval_pending, payment_pending (Awaiting You)
- in_progress, scheduled
- shipped, delivered (Orders)
- completed, cancelled, unable (Terminal)
```

### 3. Services API ✅
Created `/app/backend/services_routes.py`:
- `GET /api/os/services/launchers` - 8 featured services
- `GET /api/os/services/inbox` - Tickets grouped by status
- `GET /api/os/services/awaiting` - Awaiting You shelf
- `GET /api/os/services/orders` - Orders with shipping
- `GET /api/os/services/watchlist` - For TODAY integration
- `POST /api/os/services/request` - Create request
- `PATCH /api/os/services/ticket/{id}` - User actions

### 4. Services Panel UI ✅
Created `/app/frontend/src/components/Mira/ServicesPanel.jsx`:
- Service Launchers grid (8 services)
- Awaiting You shelf (killer UX)
- Active Requests with status tabs
- Orders section
- Clean, professional UI (icons, no emojis)

---

## SERVICES REMAINING WORK (40% gap)

Per user's architecture vision:
1. **Request Builder Modal** - Tap launcher → structured form
2. **Full Ticket Detail View** - Mobile: list → detail page
3. **User Action Flows** - Confirm date, approve quote, pay
4. **Multi-pet Task UI** - Pet selector inside task
5. **Preferences Capture** - "Save groomer?" on completion
6. **Awaiting You Badge** - Notification dot on Services tab
7. **TODAY Watchlist Integration** - Use `/api/os/services/watchlist`

---

## TODAY REMAINING WORK (5% gap)

1. **Active Tasks Watchlist enrichment:**
   - "Awaiting your confirmation" - Use Services watchlist API
   - "Concierge is scheduling" - Status display
   - "Payment pending" - Status display
   - "Order shipped" - Use shipping status

2. **Stale/Offline indicator** - Show if data > 5 min old
