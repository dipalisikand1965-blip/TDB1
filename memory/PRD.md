## SESSION 13 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### P0 LEARN → TODAY Integration - Complete ✅
**Goal:** Connect LEARN and TODAY layers with smart nudges and deep links

**What was built:**

#### A) TODAY → LEARN Deep Links
- Created `TODAY_TO_LEARN_MAP` mapping alert types to Learn guides
- `GET /api/os/learn/deep-link-map` endpoint returns enriched mapping with titles
- Deep link format: `/os?tab=learn&open={type}:{id}&pet_id={pet_id}&src=today:{alert_type}`
- Maps seasonal alerts, due soon cards, and urgent items to relevant Learn content

#### B) LEARN → TODAY Smart Nudges (One Card, One Week)
- **Backend:**
  - `POST /api/os/learn/event` - Records user events (saved, completed, helpful, not_helpful)
  - `GET /api/os/learn/today-nudge?pet_id=` - Returns ONE eligible nudge (anti-spam rules enforced)
  - `POST /api/os/learn/today-nudge/ack` - Acknowledges nudge display, starts 7-day cooldown
  - `POST /api/os/learn/today-nudge/dismiss` - "Not now" dismissal
- **Anti-Spam Rules (all must be true):**
  1. User completed/saved a Learn item
  2. Item has service mapping in `LEARN_TO_SERVICE_MAP`
  3. No Learn-nudge shown in last 7 days for that pet
  4. Same item hasn't nudged in 30 days
- **Frontend:**
  - `LearnNudgeCard` component with primary/secondary/dismiss actions
  - Primary → Opens ServiceRequestBuilder with LEARN prefill
  - Secondary → Opens ConciergePanel with LEARN context
  - AbortController + ACK pattern fixes React StrictMode race condition

#### C) Data Model
- `learn_events`: {user_id, pet_id, item_id, item_type, event_type, ts}
- `today_nudge_log`: {user_id, pet_id, nudge_type, item_id, shown_at, dismissed_at}

#### Test Results
- **Testing Agent Report:** `/app/test_reports/iteration_193.json`
- **Backend:** 100% - All endpoints working
- **Frontend:** 100% - LearnNudgeCard displays correctly

---

### P0 LEARN Integrations - Verified & Tested ✅
**Goal:** Test and verify the P0 integrations connecting LEARN → SERVICES and LEARN → CONCIERGE

**What was done:**

#### ConciergePanel.jsx Updates
- Added `initialContext` prop handling for LEARN context
- Displays "You were reading:" banner with guide title when coming from LEARN
- Pre-fills message input: "I've read '[Title]'. Help me understand this better for [pet_name]."
- WhatsApp/Email messages now include LEARN context
- "Start Chat" button highlighted when LEARN context present

#### ServiceRequestBuilder.jsx Updates

- Displays "BASED ON YOUR READING" banner with guide title and context note
- Pre-fills notes field with LEARN context
- Auto-fills handling notes and time preferences from MOJO prefill

## SESSION 12 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### P0 LEARN Personalization - "Pet First, Breed Second" ✅
**Goal:** Implement personalization for LEARN layer following the golden doctrine

**What was built:**

#### Backend Safety Updates
- Changed wording from "conditions" → "explicit sensitivities, routines, behaviour signals (no inference)"
- Renamed `allergies` → `food_sensitive` tag (no medical language)
- Removed `health_issues` tag (was inferring from medical data)
- **Health-adjacent topics ignore breed tags entirely** (`HEALTH_ADJACENT_TOPICS`)
- **Breed tag contribution capped at +10** (prevents breed-dominance)
- **User feedback penalty is per user + per pet, not global** (-15 for "Not helpful")
- **Diversity filter:** Max 2 items with same primary tag in "For your pet"

#### P0 CTA Integrations (Code Written)
- **"Let Mira do it" → Services:** One tap opens `ServiceRequestBuilder` with:
  - `source_layer: "learn"`
  - `source_item: {type, id, title}`
  - `service_type` from CTA mapping
  - `prefill` from MOJO + CTA
  - `context_note` (what they read + what they're trying to do)

- **"Ask Mira" → Concierge:** Opens with zero re-asking:
  - `learn_item: {title, type, id}`
  - `derived_tags_used` (pet tags only for health topics)
  - `suggested_next_action`
  - Pre-filled message: "I've read X. Help me with Y."

#### Documentation Updates
- Added OS Layer Correlation Map to LEARN_BIBLE.md
- Added P0 Integration specifications
- Updated safety rules and feedback penalty documentation

## SESSION 10 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### P1 Mobile Tidy-up ✅
**Goal:** iOS Safari + Android Chrome PWA compatibility.

**Key Fixes:**
1. **Input Zoom Prevention**: All inputs use `text-base` (16px) to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom
2. **Body Scroll Lock**: TodayPanel, ServiceRequestBuilder, TicketDetailPanel using position:fixed technique
3. **Dynamic Viewport Units**: Changed 100vh to 100dvh for proper iOS Safari viewport
4. **Safe Area Padding**: Added `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to bottom sheet modals
5. **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet 44px minimum
6. **touch-manipulation CSS**: Added to prevent 300ms tap delay

**Bug Fixed:** TicketDetailPanel `isOpen` undefined in scroll lock useEffect

**Viewports Tested:** iPhone 14 Pro (390x844) ✅, iPhone SE (375x667) ✅, Desktop ✅

---

### P0.2 TODAY Watchlist Integration ✅
**Goal:** Today panel shows "in-motion" work from the ticket backbone.

**Statuses included:**
- `clarification_needed`, `options_ready`, `approval_pending`, `payment_pending` → "Awaiting You" section
- `in_progress`, `scheduled`, `shipped` → "In Progress" section

**Components Updated:**
- **TodayPanel.jsx** - New watchlist sections
  - `WatchlistTaskCard` - Displays ticket with status icon and one-tap action
  - `fetchWatchlist` useEffect - Calls `/api/os/services/watchlist` endpoint
  - "Awaiting You" section with quick action buttons (Reply, Choose, Approve, Pay)
  - "In Progress" section with View button
  - Stale indicator (orange pulsing icon) when data > 5 min old

**Bug Fixed:**
- Empty `apiUrl` was treated as falsy, preventing watchlist fetch (apiUrl is intentionally empty for relative paths)

**Test Results:**
- Backend: 100% - 14/14 tests passed
- Frontend: 100% - All sections render correctly

---

## SESSION 9 ACCOMPLISHMENTS (Feb 14, 2026)

### 1. CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Login Redirect ✅
- **Issue:** After login on `/mira-demo`, users were redirected to `/dashboard` instead of back to `/mira-demo`
- **Root Cause:** `Login.jsx` hardcoded `navigate('/dashboard')` after successful login
- **Fix:** Updated `Login.jsx` to use `location.state?.from` (passed by ProtectedRoute) to redirect users back to their original destination
- **File:** `/app/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` (lines 1-30)
- **Impact:** This was blocking all access to the Pet OS UI - the `PetOSNavigation` was rendering correctly, but users couldn't see it because they were redirected away

### 2. SERVICES Execution Loop COMPLETE ✅
**Unified Pipeline (HARDCODED):** User Request → Service Desk Ticket → Admin Notification → Member Notification → Pillar Request → Tickets → Channel Intakes

**Components Built:**
- **ServiceRequestBuilder.jsx** - Full-screen modal on mobile, modal on desktop
  - Pet selection with avatar chips
  - Service-specific presets (Grooming, Training, Boarding, etc.)
  - Date/time preferences, location, notes
  - Device type detection (mobile/desktop)
  
- **TicketDetailPanel.jsx** - Ticket view with timeline
  - Status timeline with visual progress
  - Details section (pets, time, location, notes)
  - Action buttons based on status (approve, pay, cancel)
  
- **Backend Pipeline** (`services_routes.py`):
  - STEP 1: Generate Service Desk Ticket ID
  - STEP 2: Build ticket document with full metadata
  - STEP 3: Insert into mira_tickets
  - STEP 4: Admin notification (admin_notifications collection)
  - STEP 5: Member notification (notifications collection)
  - STEP 6: Pillar request logging (pillar_requests collection)
  - STEP 7: Channel intake record (channel_intakes collection)

### 3. Legacy Bug Fixes ✅
- **`/api/orders` 405 error:** Added GET endpoint to orders_routes.py
- **Chat markdown rendering:** Updated ChatMessage.jsx with cross-browser compatible styles

### 4. Testing Results ✅
- **Backend:** 100% - 12/12 pytest tests passed
- **Frontend:** 95% - All core flows working
- Test file: `/app/backend/tests/test_services_inbox_os.py`

### 5. Frontend Verified Working ✅
- **PetOSNavigation:** All 7 OS layer tabs visible (MOJO, TODAY, PICKS, SERVICES, INSIGHTS, LEARN, CONCIERGE®)
- **PICKS Panel:** Products and services displaying correctly with personalized recommendations
- **SERVICES Panel:** Service launchers, Request Builder, Ticket Detail all working
- **Mobile:** Services panel works correctly on 390x844 viewport

- File: `/app/backend/scoring_logic.py` line 433
- Changed: `classification.pillar` → `classification.primary_pillar`
- Impact: Picks were returning 0 results due to attribute error

### 2. Unified Status Taxonomy ✅
Created `/app/backend/ticket_status_system.py`:
```
Canonical Statuses:
- draft, placed
- clarification_needed, options_ready, approval_pending, payment_pending (Awaiting You)
- in_progress, scheduled
- shipped, delivered (Orders)
- completed, cancelled, unable (Terminal)
```

### 3. Services API ✅

- `GET /api/os/services/orders` - Orders with shipping
- `GET /api/os/services/watchlist` - For TODAY integration
- `POST /api/os/services/request` - Create request

### 4. Services Panel UI ✅
Created `/app/frontend/src/components/Mira/ServicesPanel.jsx`:
- Service Launchers grid (8 services)
- Awaiting You shelf (killer UX)
- Active Requests with status tabs
- Orders section
- Clean, professional UI (icons, no emojis)

---

## SERVICES REMAINING WORK (40% gap)

Per user's architecture vision:
1. **Request Builder Modal** - Tap launcher → structured form
2. **Full Ticket Detail View** - Mobile: list → detail page
3. **User Action Flows** - Confirm date, approve quote, pay
4. **Multi-pet Task UI** - Pet selector inside task
5. **Preferences Capture** - "Save groomer?" on completion
6. **Awaiting You Badge** - Notification dot on Services tab
7. **TODAY Watchlist Integration** - Use `/api/os/services/watchlist`

---

## TODAY REMAINING WORK (5% gap)

1. **Active Tasks Watchlist enrichment:**
   - "Awaiting your confirmation" - Use Services watchlist API
   - "Concierge is scheduling" - Status display
   - "Payment pending" - Status display
   - "Order shipped" - Use shipping status

2. **Stale/Offline indicator** - Show if data > 5 min old
