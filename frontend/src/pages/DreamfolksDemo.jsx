**Possible Causes:**
• Skin allergies (environmental or food-related)
• Dry skin from grooming products
• Parasites (fleas/mites)
• Seasonal irritation

**My Recommendation:**
Since Dollar is allergic to chicken, let's first rule out any food-related triggers. I'd suggest:

1. **Immediate:** Anti-itch oatmeal bath (₹450 at Pawsome Spa)
2. **This week:** Vet dermatology check-up

📅 **Available Appointments:**
• Dr. Sharma, PetCare Clinic - Tomorrow 11 AM
• VetDerm Specialists - Thursday 3 PM

Should I book one of these?`,

**Possible Reasons:**
• Digestive upset
• Dental discomfort
• Stress or environmental change
• Underlying health issue

**Immediate Steps:**
1. Try warming his food slightly (enhances aroma)
2. Offer his favorite: peanut butter biscuits as a test
3. Monitor water intake

⚠️ **If he hasn't eaten for 24+ hours, we should see a vet.**

📅 **Quick Vet Availability:**

Vomiting can indicate several things — from simple stomach upset to something more serious.

**Right Now:**
